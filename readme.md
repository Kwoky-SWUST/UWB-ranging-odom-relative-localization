## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   ROS (Robot Operating System) -  This project likely depends on ROS for robot control and data processing.  Refer to the [ROS installation guide](http://wiki.ros.org/Installation) for your specific operating system.
*   C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
*   CMake -  Used for building the project.
*   Required ROS packages (dependencies):  These will depend on the specific nodes used in the project.  You'll need to identify and install them using `apt-get install ros-<distro>-<package-name>` or similar.  Common dependencies might include:
    *   `roscpp`
    *   `rospy` (if any Python nodes are used)
    *   `sensor_msgs`
    *   `geometry_msgs`
    *   `tf`
    *   Packages related to your specific UWB hardware and odometry source.

### Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kwoky-SWUST/UWB-ranging-odom-relative-localization.git
    cd UWB-ranging-odom-relative-localization
    ```

2.  **Create a ROS workspace (if you don't have one already):**

    ```bash
    mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
    cd catkin_ws/src
    catkin_init_workspace
    ```

3.  **Move the repository into the `src` directory of your ROS workspace:**

    ```bash
    mv UWB-ranging-odom-relative-localization .
    ```

4.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    cd ..
    catkin_make
    ```

5.  **Source the ROS environment:**

    ```bash
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```

    Add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to automatically source the environment each time you open a new terminal.

## Key Features

*   **UWB Ranging:**  Implements functionality for reading and processing Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging data.
*   **Odometry Integration:**  Integrates odometry data (e.g., from wheel encoders or an IMU) to estimate robot pose.
*   **Relative Localization:**  Combines UWB ranging and odometry to perform relative localization, allowing robots to determine their positions relative to each other or to known anchor points.
*   **Potential for Multi-Robot Systems:** The directory structure suggests support for multi-robot applications.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Includes directories for `hokuyo_node` and `rplidar_ros`, indicating support for laser scanners.

## API Documentation

Detailed API documentation is not available in this README.  Refer to the source code comments within the `src` directory for information on specific functions and classes.  Pay close attention to the following directories:

*   `src/single_uwb_relative_localization`:  Likely contains the core logic for UWB-based relative localization.
*   `src/filters`: May contain filtering algorithms (e.g., Kalman filters) used to improve localization accuracy.
*   `src/multi_robots_formation`, `src/multi_robots_navgation`:  If you are working with multiple robots, these directories will be relevant.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome!  To contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.**
3.  **Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive commit messages.**
4.  **Submit a pull request.**

Please ensure that your code adheres to the following guidelines:

*   **Code Style:** Follow the existing code style.
*   **Comments:**  Add comments to explain your code.
*   **Testing:**  If possible, add tests to verify your changes.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Compilation Errors:**  Ensure that all required ROS packages are installed and that your ROS environment is properly sourced.
*   **UWB Data Issues:**  Verify that your UWB hardware is properly configured and that you are receiving valid ranging data.  Check the ROS topics being published by your UWB driver.
*   **Localization Accuracy:**  Localization accuracy can be affected by factors such as UWB ranging errors, odometry drift, and environmental conditions.  Consider using filtering techniques (e.g., Kalman filters) to improve accuracy.  Calibrate your sensors carefully.
*   **Multi-Robot Communication:** If using the multi-robot features, ensure that the robots can communicate with each other over the ROS network.
